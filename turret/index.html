					<u>Basic Controls</u><br/><br/>
					You can aim and fire the turret by clicking the buttons below.
					Use the live video feed on the right from the turret's webcam
					to see what you're aiming at. There is a small laser attached
					to the bottom of the turret to help you aim, as well. Keep in
					mind that it takes a little bit of time for the turret to get
					ready to fire again, and make sure to keep an eye on how much
					ammo you have left. You can also control the turret by using
					the following controls while in the applet:<br/><br/>
					<u>
						W = UP<br/>
						A = LEFT<br/>
						S = DOWN<br/>
						D = RIGHT<br/>
						SPACE = FIRE
					</u>
